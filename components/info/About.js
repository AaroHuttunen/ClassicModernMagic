                Classic Modern is a player-created Magic: The Gathering format designed to capture the feeling of old-school Modern without the "FIRE" design philosophy and the cards printed straight into Modern through Modern Horizons and similar sets.
                The format allows for cards printed in sets from Eighth Edition to Journey into Nyx.
                Classic Modern was created as a response to the fast-paced and high-powered nature of the current Modern format, which often features highly efficient cards with multiple abilities and complex interactions.
                Classic Modern offers a more focused and strategic gameplay experience, with a focus on synergistic decks and more deliberate decision-making.
                Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the original Modern format or a newer player looking for a fresh and exciting challenge, Classic Modern offers a unique and rewarding experience that is both nostalgic and innovative. 
                Come join us and experience the thrill of a format designed by the players, for the players!
